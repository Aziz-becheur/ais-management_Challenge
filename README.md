Dear User,
In order to execute the code you will need to consider the following conditions:

      - create a virtual environment
      - have python3.11 installed
      - install the requirements.txt
      - If you plan to Execute the code, the Notebook "create_mapping.ipynb will require an OpenAI API key. Please create one and paste it there first. otherwise, you can replace it with the pretrained model that is also used in that notebook."
